# 10. Testing Strategy

The project will follow the Testing Pyramid model, with a strong emphasis on automated tests and performance validation.

### 10.1 Unit Testing (Jest)

- **Services Layer:** Mock Firebase services, test business logic
- **Utility Functions:** Spatial indexing, performance calculations, validation
- **Custom Hooks:** Canvas interactions, state management, real-time subscriptions
- **Components:** Isolated component testing with mocked dependencies

### 10.2 Integration Testing (React Testing Library)

- **Canvas Interactions:** Pan, zoom, node creation/manipulation
- **Real-time Features:** Multi-user collaboration scenarios
- **File Operations:** Upload, download, drag-and-drop workflows
- **Error Handling:** Network failures, invalid inputs, edge cases

### 10.3 End-to-End Testing (Playwright)

- **Critical User Flows:** Complete workflows from entry to collaboration
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- **Performance Testing:** Load times, FPS measurements, memory usage
- **Mobile Testing:** Touch interactions, responsive behavior

### 10.4 Performance Testing

- **Load Testing:** Simulate multiple concurrent users
- **Stress Testing:** Large numbers of nodes, heavy file uploads
- **Memory Profiling:** Memory leaks, garbage collection patterns
- **Real-time Latency:** Measure and validate collaboration delays

### 10.5 Security Testing

- **Input Validation:** XSS prevention, file upload security
- **Rate Limiting:** Verify abuse prevention mechanisms
- **Firebase Rules:** Test security rule enforcement
