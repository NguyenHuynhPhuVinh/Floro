# 9. Security and Performance

### 9.1 Security Architecture

- **Supabase Row Level Security (RLS):**
  - Enforce data validation and access control at the database level
  - Rate limiting policies for database operations
  - File type and size restrictions via storage policies
- **Client-Side Security:**
  - Input sanitization for all user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
  - File upload validation (type, size, content scanning)
- **Rate Limiting Strategy:**
  - IP-based rate limiting: 10 nodes/minute, 100 nodes/hour
  - Session-based limits for high-frequency operations
  - Exponential backoff for repeated violations
- **Data Protection:**
  - No personal data collection (anonymous sessions)
  - Automatic cleanup of inactive sessions
  - Content moderation hooks for inappropriate content

### 9.2 Performance Optimization

- **Canvas Performance:**
  - **Viewport Virtualization:** Only render nodes within viewport + buffer zone
  - **Level of Detail (LOD):** Simplified rendering when zoomed out
  - **Spatial Partitioning:** Quadtree-based spatial indexing for efficient queries
  - **Batch Rendering:** Group similar operations to reduce draw calls
- **Data Loading:**
  - **Lazy Loading:** Defer loading of images and files until needed
  - **Progressive Loading:** Load thumbnails first, full resolution on demand
  - **Caching Strategy:** Multi-layer caching (browser, CDN, Supabase)
- **Real-time Optimization:**
  - **Debounced Updates:** Batch high-frequency updates (cursor, drag)
  - **Connection Management:** Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - **Selective Subscriptions:** Only subscribe to data in current viewport
- **Memory Management:**
  - **Object Pooling:** Reuse canvas objects to reduce GC pressure
  - **Cleanup Strategies:** Automatic cleanup of off-screen resources
  - **Memory Monitoring:** Track and alert on memory usage patterns
